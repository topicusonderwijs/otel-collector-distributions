# OpenTelemetry Collector Cloudflare Logs Distro

This distributions contains the components from both the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector) repository and the [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) repository required for a dedicated [Cloudflare Logs Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/cloudflarereceiver) distro. This allows Cloudflare's [LogPush Jobs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/) to send logs over HTTPS from the Cloudflare logs aggregation system.
